This app is like Yik Yak but specifically for events. Enter an event room using a code given by the event organizers, and join the anonymous chat!

To create an event, simply click the button and enter a new Event Name and Event Code. Your event code must be unique!

Share the app link and event code with your event-goers so they can join the chat!

If you are an event participant, simply enter the code given to you into the message box and hit send to access the event chat!
